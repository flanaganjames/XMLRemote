REASON FOR CONSULTATION
To evaluate patient with infection at the PEG tube site.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
This is an 89-year-old female who was brought in to this institution on the 04/13/2013,
 complained that the PEG tube was displaced and was not able to be fed.  She has some wounds in
 both of her feet that are being addressed by Dr. Mennuti, podiatrist.  Both feet are bandaged,
 therefore, I did not have a chance to evaluate them; however, I examined the patient and I
 interviewed; she is not a good historian.  She is mostly bedbound, therefore all the information
 I obtained from the medical record.

3.  MRSA screen.
4.  Sputum for C and S needed.
5.  Follow blood cultures taken today.
6.  Follow white blood count, temperature, vital signs, etc.
