Consultation Information
  Reason for consultation  :  AMS.  
  Subjective: :  58 y/o woman presents with AMS. She is not abole to provide hx. She is
   accompanied by a friend who reports that the patient was c/o a severe HA yesterday and went
   home from work. She continued to have the HA today and the friend took the patient to her PCP.
   She was normal up to this point. Apparently her physician recommended that she come to the ER.
   Shortly after that she became obtunded. She was not able to speak for a period time. I saw her
   in ER after her CTA was complete. By that time she was arousable, and able to say a few words,
   but still obtunded. Her friend inidcated that the patient had taken some medication for the HA
   yesterday, but did not take any today as far as she knew. .

Review / Management
  Diagnosis/Impression :   58 y/o woman with AMS and aphasia. Presentation would be atypical
     for stroke. An ischemic event of sufficient size to cause such symptoms should be readily
     apparent on CTA. Also, the lack of motor involvement or other focal signs make an acute
     stroke less likely. Her presentation with progressive HA and AMS and now focal deficit is
     very concerning for meningitis..  
  Plan :  I would recommend lumbar puncture to evaluate for infection. 

  I would also start empiric tx for meningitis with antibiotics and acyclovir. 

  An MRI would be helpful after the LP has been done and tx started. 

  Will follow

  Thank you for the consultation..
