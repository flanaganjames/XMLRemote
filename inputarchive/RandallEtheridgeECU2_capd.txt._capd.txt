CHIEF COMPLAINT
The patient presents today with chest pain and new onset nocturnal shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
First symptoms began about a week ago while the patient was vacation. He has also complained of ankle swelling that worsens as the day progresses.  Onset of gripping constant chest pain was less than 2 hours ago. There has been no fever, chills or other symptoms to suggest infection.

MEDICATIONS
Metoprolol 25 mg po bid,  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po daily.
ALLERGIES
NKA
SOCIAL HISTORY
The patient denies smoking and drinking alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAM
Vital signs are within normal limits other than a systolic BP of 160.  The exam is remarkable for bilateral rales half way up the back, 2+ pitting edema to the knees, and a gallop rhythm.  Exam otherwise normal.
RESULTS
EKG reveals non-specific ST and T wave changes. Troponin elevated. BNP elevated.  Chest x-ray displays Kerly-B lines and cephalization. Cardiac echo pending.
ASSESSMENT
Probable subendocardial MI.  Cardiac insufficiency.
PLAN
Admit to CCU. Consult Cardiology. Continue enalapril 10 mg po bid and convert diuretics to IV.  Received aspirin in the ED.
CLARIFICATIONS
The diagnosis of acute diastolic heart failure is supported by the following evidence: recent onset of symptoms, nocturnal dyspnea, rales, history of diastolic dysfunction, BNP is high, ACE inhibitor prescribed, diuretics intensified.
